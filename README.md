## This repository is for a take home object detection challenge
This challenge required us to use transfer learning ml approach to solve the problem.
Task: I had to use some images shared by the organisation as the training set and output the coordinates for the bounding boxes containing the twitter “following button”.

The output should be a list of arrays containing the bounding boxes of the following buttons for each picture:

[ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]

## Hint: for validation, keep 1 picture away from the training data and then use it as the validation image.
